                <p><span style="font-size: 40px;">Community Outreach Programs</span><br>The Tangub City Police Station, together with partners like the Department of Education and local stakeholders, organized a community outreach program at Baluc Elementary School. During this event, volunteers distributed school bags, food, and drinks to students, and brought joy through games and storytelling via a mobile library activity. This initiative aimed to support students’ learning and well‑being through direct engagement and service — a beautiful expression of community care and solidarity.</p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 40px;">City-wide Support to Others</span><br>Tangub City demonstrated generosity beyond its borders by donating ₱1.29 million to families affected by Typhoon Tino in Cebu. City representatives handed over cash aid to support those recovering from the disaster, showing how even a local community can extend kindness and help to people in need outside their own region.</p>

This type of support highlights how communities can work together to ensure access to education and digital learning tools for young people.</p>

From outreach programs at local schools that bring learning materials and smiles to children, to extending assistance to families affected by natural disasters in other provinces, our city’s initiatives embody the true spirit of bayanihan — helping one another with open hearts. Supporting education through tech donations and mobilizing volunteers shows that when we work together, we not only uplift our own community but also bring hope to others beyond our borders.”</p>
