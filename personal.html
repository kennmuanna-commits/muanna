                <p>-Faith is more than belief; it is a guiding light in our daily lives.
                    It shapes how we respond to challenges, interact with others, and 
                    make decisions. When we allow faith to lead us, we cultivate patience,
                    hope, and compassion. It encourages us to see beyond immediate 
                    circumstances and trust in a higher purpose, inspiring us to act 
                    with love and kindness even when it is not easy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faith">
                <p>-Integrity is living in alignment with our values, even when no one is
                    watching. It is the courage to do what is right, the honesty to admit
                    mistakes, and the humility to learn from them. Integrity builds trust
                    and respect, and it is the foundation of meaningful relationships.
                    Choosing integrity is a daily practice that strengthens character
                    and leaves a lasting impact on the people and communities around us.</p>

            <div class="faith"> 
                <p>-In today’s connected world, our online actions matter as much as our
                    offline ones. Responsible digital citizenship means using technology
                    thoughtfully and ethically: respecting others, protecting privacy,
                    and sharing accurate information. It is about creating a positive
                    digital environment and being mindful of how our words and actions
                    affect others. When guided by faith and integrity, our digital
                    presence can inspire, uplift, and contribute to a better online world.</p>
